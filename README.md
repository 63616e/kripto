# Kripto

Well,there's a crypto-craze in the world at the moment. I was bored in the middle of the night, and I had pretty much nothing else to do, so I made this website by reference. 


I don't think I have to tell the people who are planning to use this to NOT use this as your main source of data.

 Bank of England Governor mentioned a very vital thing about cryptos, “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”
